We are looking to open a brewery! We have a name, we have a goal, but in order to meet that goal we need to understand our customer. Using the data of 500+ breweries across the United States, we looked at the trends of beer drinkers and their preferences to come to conclusions on how to best move forward with our business endeavor. 

First, we looked at the number of breweries in each state to determine where the beer drinkers are. States with higher numbers of breweries may be good options for opening store locations and/or great locations to market to. We also took a look at up and coming locations that are great areas to target and perhaps not as oversaturated. We also found where the states with the least amount of breweries are to determine which areas beer drinking is not as popular.

Then, we wanted to find out which styles of beer are most popular amongst beer drinkers in the United States. We wanted to understand which styles are the most popular to determine which products we should launch with. 

Next, we used our data analysis skills to see what quantities (in ounces) that beer consumers prefer when ordering beer. 

We were also curious about ABVs effect on bitterness. If our beer is higher in alcohol content will its taste be more bitter than those beers with lower alcohol by volume. We also looked at the comparison of two of the top ten beers (American IPAs and American Blonde Ale) and their ABV percentages to see if IPAs tended to be higher.

We will use all of this information to strategically decide the best way to launch our beer business!
