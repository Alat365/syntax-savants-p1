We are looking to open a brewery! We have a name, we have a goal, but in order to meet that goal we need to understand our customer. Using the data of 500+ breweries across the United States, we looked at the trends of beer drinkers and their preferences to come to conclusions on how to best move forward with our business endeavor. 

First, we looked at the number of breweries in each state to determine where the beer drinkers are. States with higher numbers of breweries may be good options for opening store locations and/or great locations to market to. We also took a look at up and coming locations that are great areas to target and perhaps not as oversaturated. We also found where the states with the least amount of breweries are to determine which areas beer drinking is not as popular.

Then, we wanted to find out which styles of beer are most popular amongst beer drinkers in the United States. We wanted to understand which styles are the most popular to determine which products we should launch with. 

Next, we used our data analysis skills to see what quantities (in ounces) that beer consumers prefer when ordering beer. 

We then looked at beer ratings and how they were affected by ABV and IBU of each beer. Do our future customers prefer beer that is higher in alcohol by volume? How does the level of bitterness affect their overall opinion of the beer?

We will use all of this information to strategically decide the best way to launch our beer business!
